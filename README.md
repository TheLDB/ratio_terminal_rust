# Ratio Terminal (But in rust)

**Disclaimer**
i heavily reccomend you use the [actual ratioterminal](https://github.com/idkwuu/RatioTerminal), i just did this to better understand [serenity, the discord rust package](https://github.com/serenity), and it shouldn't *actually* be used

Remember Ratio Terminal from [idkwuu](https://github.com/idkwuu)? Well, heres ratio terminal but written in rust (better)

Requires Rust (tested with v1.57.0).

 `cargo run` 

Add this ratio *soon*

**plz dont kill me idkwuu this is just for fun**
